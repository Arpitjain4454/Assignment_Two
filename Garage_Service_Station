Question 2:-
Please implement a software for a car service station using Object Oriented Programming. If you are not familiar or
comfortable with object-oriented programming, we suggest you give this article a quick read to ensure you
understand it before you attempt it.

It should have the following features:
The car service station caters to different types of cars – Hatchback, Sedan, SUV.

It provides different types of services like Basic Service, Engine Fixing, Clutch Fixing, Gear Fixing and Brake Fixing.
Each service has a service code associated with it and different prices for different types of cars.

The software should generate a detailed bill with the total amount for each service request based on the Type of
Car specified and the requested Service Codes.

Example:
Type of Car – Hatchback
Service Codes – BS01, EF01
Charges for Basic Servicing – ₹ 2000
Charges for Engine Fixing – ₹ 5000
Total Bill – ₹ 7000
In addition, if the total service bill is more than ₹ 10000, a complimentary cleaning should be provided and specified
in the bill.

Answer 1-

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

enum CarType {
  HATCHBACK, SEDAN, SUV
}

enum ServiceType {
  BS01("Basic Service", 2000), EF01("Engine Fixing", 5000), CF01("Clutch Fixing", 4000), GF01("Gear Fixing", 3000), BF01("Brake Fixing", 2500);

  private String serviceName;
  private int price;

  ServiceType(String serviceName, int price) {
    this.serviceName = serviceName;
    this.price = price;
  }

  public int getPrice() {
    return price;
  }

  public String getServiceName() {
    return serviceName;
  }
}

class CarService {
  private CarType carType;
  private ArrayList<ServiceType> services;

  public CarService(CarType carType) {
    this.carType = carType;
    services = new ArrayList<ServiceType>();
  }

  public void addService(ServiceType service) {
    services.add(service);
  }

  public int getTotalCost() {
    int totalCost = 0;
    for (ServiceType service : services) {
      totalCost += service.getPrice();
    }
    return totalCost;
  }

  public void generateBill() {
    System.out.println("Type of Car: " + carType);
    System.out.println("Services: ");
    for (ServiceType service : services) {
      System.out.println(service.getServiceName() + " - ₹ " + service.getPrice());
    }
    int totalCost = getTotalCost();
    System.out.println("Total Bill: ₹ " + totalCost);
    if (totalCost > 10000) {
      System.out.println("Complimentary cleaning provided.");
    }
  }
}

public class CarServiceStation {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.println("Enter the type of car (HATCHBACK, SEDAN, SUV):");
    String carTypeString = sc.nextLine();
    CarType carType = CarType.valueOf(carTypeString.toUpperCase());

    CarService carService = new CarService(carType);

    System.out.println("Enter the service codes (BS01, EF01, CF01, GF01, BF01) separated by commas:");
    String servicesString = sc.nextLine();
    String[] servicesArray = servicesString.split(",");
    for (String serviceString : servicesArray) {
      ServiceType serviceType = ServiceType.valueOf(serviceString.trim().toUpperCase());
      carService.addService(serviceType);
    }

    carService.generateBill();

    sc.close();
  }
}
